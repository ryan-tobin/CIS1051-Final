# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

NFL Live Statistics Webpage

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Create a webpage to display live statistics of teams and individual players for users to track. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS, I can create a mult-page responsive webpage that lets users track current live statistics of NFL players and teams. This data will come from an API (still to be determined what specific API) and display info througout a responsive main page with subsequent sub pages dedicated to certain areas of stats. Those specific stats may be Passing, Rushing, Sacks, or any other high profile stats that users may care about. Time permitting, adding a subpage to be able to "pin" a users favorite players for them to be able to track multi-player stats on one single, cohesive page. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1. Main Page with top stats of the day
2. Main page with a column of breaking news stories that may imapact player statistics
3. Subpage(s) with certain top players for certain stat categories 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

{#'s 1-3 of Good Outcome} +
1. Top row of current games being played, and current scores.
2. Subpage where certain teams and/or players can be searched 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

{#"s 1-3 of Good Outcome and #'s 1 & 2 of Better Outcome} +
1. Subpage where a user will be able "pin" favorite players or players they want to track stats of
2. Subpage including possible fantasy leaders (PPR) for certain categories {using an API}
3. Login/Sign Up function for users to login and be able to favorite players/teams

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Following this project, concurrent devolpment of this webapge could be possible to full scale launch as a reliable website for users to use. A new skill that will need to be learned and researched further for me is the use of API's within webpages and the action of populating a webapge using API (json) data. I currently have a baseline knowledge of JS, whereas a somewhat more advanced knowledge of HTML and CSS.
