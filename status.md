#### What have you done for your project so far?

API Data displaying for live games and scores, API Data displaying for NFL Divisional Wins/Losses, API Data displaying for Teams pashing yards for the year, API Data displaying rushing yards for the year. Homepage with navbar linking to News page, Teams page, Players page and linking back to the Home page. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Find an API to display Live player statistics, or set up players page or fantasy page (tbd if doing this page)

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My main issue I ran into (and fixed) was being able to display the data that the API gave to me in JSON format. Another problem I am running into is making the webpage responsive, and also finding an API that gives me live player data.
